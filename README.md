# Book_recommender_system
My research topic for the data science capstone project is to design a multi-stakeholder book recommendation system for libraries. In the past, the recommender system was consumer-centric and they only recommended desired products for consumers, not considering other stakeholdersâ€™ needs. However, with the emergence of two-sided or even multi-sided marketplaces (e.g. elema, Airbnb) in recent years, our focus should not be limited only to consumers. Suppliers, platforms and society are all important stakeholders for system developers to consider, to fulfill their assorted needs. Our project is set in the university, and intends to design a book recommendation system for university libraries. We would like to maximize the satisfaction of both university libraries and students who want to borrow books. Collaborated with the NYU library, we are developing a model that offers students desired books, while promoting under-exposed books on the shelves.
